HHA 507 Assignment 9

 Dataset from Prof. Hans modified version of SPARCS - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2022/main/autoML/datasets/data_sparcs.csv) 

1. Two experiments:
    - AutoML_1:
        - focused around binary classification sudying the type of admissions as the dependent variables
        - Xgboost was selected as the best model type as the metric value was 0.000298613, whereas the metric value for baseline model was 1.04705
        - AOC
    - AutoML_2:
        - focused around regression studying the total cost as the continuous variable
        - Ensemble was selected as the best model type as the mettric value was 6451.44, whereas the metric value for baseline model was 23541.3
